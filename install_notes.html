			<h2>About</h2>
				<p>webxray is a tool for analyzing third-party content on webpages and identifying the companies which collect user data.  A command line user interface makes webxray easy to use for non-programmers, and those with advanced needs may analyze millions of pages with proper configuration.  webxray is a professional tool designed for academic research, and may be used by privacy compliance officers, regulators, and those who are generally curious about hidden data flows on the web.</p>

				<p>webxray uses a custom library of domain ownership to chart the flow of data from a given third-party domain to a corporate owner, and if applicable, to parent companies.  Tracking attribution reports produced by webxray provide robust granularity.  Reports of the average numbers of third-parties and cookies per-site, most commonly occurring third-party domains and elements, volumes of data transferred, use of SSL encryption, and more are provided out-of-the-box.  A flexible data schema allows for the generation of custom reports as well as authoring extensions to add additional data sources.</p>

				<p>By default, webxray uses Chrome to load pages, stores data in a SQLite database, and can be used on a normal desktop computer.  Users with advanced needs may install webxray on a server and leverage MySQL or PostgreSQL for heavy-duty data storage.</p>

				<p>Below you will find detailed instructions on how to install the software needed to run webxray in the <a href="#dependencies">Dependencies</a> section.  The <a href="#install_webxray">Installation and First Run</a> section provides guidance on getting started.  Additional section provide instructions on <a href="#custom_scans">Using webxray to Analyze Your Own List of Pages</a>, <a href="#reports">Viewing and Understanding Reports</a>, as well as <a href="#advanced_options">Advanced Options</a>, and <a href="#help">Getting Help</a>.

		<section>
			<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
				<p>webxray depends on several pieces of software being installed on your computer in advance.  If you are familiar with installing dependencies on your own, you may install what is listed below and skip to <a href="#install_webxray">Installation and First Run</a> .  If you are not familiar with dependencies, follow the detailed instructions for <a href="#ubuntu">Ubuntu</a> and <a href="#macos">macOS</a> below.  Note that webxray can be run on Windows, but detailed instructions are not currently available.</p>

				<p>The dependences for a standard webxray install are as follows:</p>

				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>Python Version 3.4+</td>
						<td><a href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</a></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Google Chrome Version 64+</td>
						<td><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">https://www.google.com/chrome/</a></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Chromedriver</td>
						<td><a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/">https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/</a></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Selenium</td>
						<td><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium</a></td>
					</tr>
				</table>

			<h2>OS Specific Directions</h2>
				
				<h3 id="ubuntu">Installing on Ubuntu</h3>

					<h4>Step One: Install Google Chrome (if you already have Chrome go to Step Two)</h4>

						<p>If you are using Ubuntu desktop, download Chrome here: <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">https://www.google.com/chrome/</a></p>

						<p>If you are on Ubuntu server, run the following commands:</p>
						
						<p class="cli">wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb</p>
						
						<p class="cli">sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb</p>

						<p>It is likely you will get errors, if so, run the following:</p>

						<p class="cli">sudo apt -f install</p>

						<p>Run the following command to make sure chrome is installed, if you get an error try the above steps again or search the web for advice.</p>
						
						<p class="cli">google-chrome --version</p>

					<h4>Step Two: Install chromedriver</h4>

						<p>Chromedriver allows other programs to control Chrome.  You must download chromedriver from Google:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>In a browser go to: <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads">https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads</a></li>
							<li>Click on 'latest release'</li>
							<li>Download 'chromedriver_linux64.zip'</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p><em>If you are on a server you can find the correct address using the above steps on another computer and use wget to get the file to your server.</em></p>
						
						<p>Once you have downloaded chromedriver, install it with the following commands:</p>

						<p class="cli">unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip</p>
						<p class="cli">sudo mv chromedriver /usr/bin/</p>
						
						<p>Run the following command to make sure chromedriver is installed, if you get an error try the above steps again or search the web for advice.</p>
						
						<p class="cli">chromedriver --version</p>

					<h4>Step Three: Install pip3</h4>

						<p>While Ubuntu has Python3 included by default it does not include the Python3 package manager pip3, so you will need to install it using this command:</p>
		
						<p class="cli">sudo apt install python3-pip</p>
		
						<p>Run the following command to make sure pip3 is installed, if you get an error try the above steps again or search the web for advice.</p>
			
						<p class="cli">pip3 --version</p>

					<h4>Step Four: Install Selenium for Python3</h4>
			
						<p>Selenium is the glue between Python3 and web browsers, install it with the following command:</p>

						<p class="cli">sudo pip3 install selenium</p>

						<p>You are now ready to <a href="#install_webxray">install webxray</a>.
						
				<h3 id="macos">macOS Specific Directions</h3>
					
					<p> macOS is UNIX-based system and setting up webxray is relatively straight-forward.</p>

					<h4>Step One: Install Homebrew:</h4>

						<p>Homebrew is a command-line tool which helps you install and manage various other command-line tools.  To install Homebrew go to the following site and follow the instructions, note it may take some time to download and install: <a href="https://brew.sh">https://brew.sh</a>.

						<p>By default, Homebrew sends information to Google Analytics, you can disable that with the following command using the terminal (which you should have open after installing Homebrew):</p>
						<p class="cli">brew analytics off</p>

					<h4>Step Two: Install Python3</h4>

						<p>Python3 is needed to run webxray, enter the following command to install it:</p>

						<p class="cli">brew install python3</p>
				
						<p>To make sure you have the right version of Python installed run the following command:</p>
				
						<p class="cli">python3 --version</p>
				
						<p>...if you see 3.4 or above you are good to go!</p>

					<h4>Step Three: Install chromedriver</h4>

						<p>Chromedriver allows other programs to control Chrome.  Homebrew will install chomedriver for you using the following command:</p>

						<p class="cli">brew install chromedriver</p>

						<p>Run the following command to make sure chromedriver is installed, if you get an error try the above steps again or search the web for advice.</p>
					
						<p class="cli">chromedriver --version</p>

					<h4>Step Four: Install Selenium for Python3</h4>

						<p>Selenium is the glue between Python3 and web browsers, install it with the following command:</p>

						<p class="cli">sudo pip3 install selenium</p>

						<p>You are now ready to <a href="#install_webxray">install webxray</a>.
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 id="install_webxray">Installation and First Run</h2>

				<p>The basic installation uses Chrome as the browser in 'headless' mode, meaning you will not see the browser open the pages you are analyzing.  Data is stored in a SQLite database and you do not need to install a database server; databases are created in the directory './webxray/resources/db/sqlite/'. </p>

				<p>Once your dependencies are installed you can	download webxray from <a href="https://github.com/timlib/webxray">GitHub</a> or you can clone the GitHub repository using the following command:</p>
				
				<p class="cli">git clone https://github.com/timlib/webxray.git</p>
				
				<p>Now webxray is ready to go!  To use it enter the following commands:</p>
				
				<p class="cli">cd webxray</p>
				<p class="cli">python3 run_webxray.py</p>
				
				<p>This is the interactive mode and will guide you to scanning a list of sample websites.</p>

				<p><em>Note that if you are running webxray as the 'root' user it may not run properly due to limitations in Chrome.  If webxray stalls or crashes after the 'Building List of Pages' message, run webxray as a non-root user.</em></p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 id="custom_scans">Using webxray to Analyze Your Own List of Pages</h2>
			
				<p>The raison d'être of webxray is to allow you to analyze pages of your choosing.  In order to do so, first place all of the page addresses you wish to scan into a text file and place this file in the "page_lists" directory.  Make sure your addresses start with "http://" or "https://", if not, webxray will not recognize them as valid addresses.  Once you have placed your page list in the proper directory you may run webxray and it will allow you to select your page list.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 id="reports">Viewing and Understanding Reports</h2>
			
				<p>Use the interactive mode to guide you to generating an analysis once you have completed your data collection.  When it is completed it will be output to the '/reports' directory.  This will contain a number of csv files; they are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>db_summary.csv: a basic report of what is in the database and how many pages loaded</li>
					<li>stats.csv: provides top-level stats on how many domains are contacted, cookies, javascript, etc.</li>
					<li>aggregated_tracking_attribution.csv: details on percentages of sites tracked by different companies and their subsidiaries</li>
					<li>3p_domain.csv: most frequently occurring third-party domains</li>
					<li>3p_element.csv: most frequently occurring third-party elements of all types</li>
					<li>3p_image.csv: most frequently occurring third-party images</li>
					<li>3p_javascript.csv: most frequently occurring third-party javascript</li>
					<li>3p_uses.csv: high-levels stats on what first-parties use third-party services for as well as rates of cookies being set for different types of services.  Note that first-party use may be different than the ultimate third-party use.  For example, a site may use audience measurement tools from a third-party to gain insights into traffic, but the third-party may use this data for marketing.</li>
					<li>3p_ssl_use.csv: rates at which detected third-parties encrypt requests</li>
					<li>data_xfer_summary.csv: volume and percentage of data received from first- and third-party domains</li>
					<li>data_xfer_aggregated.csv: volume and percentage of data received from various companies</li>
					<li>data_xfer_by_domain.csv: volume and percentage of data received from specific third-party domains</li>
					<li>network: pairings between page domains and third-party domains, you can import this info to network visualization software</li>
					<li>per_page_data_flow.csv: one giant file that lists the requests made for each page, off by default</li>
				</ul>

			<h2 id="advanced_options">Advanced Options</h2>
		
				<p>The default installation instructions above are perfect for analyzing moderate volumes of pages (e.g. fewer than 1,000).  However, the true value of webxray is the ability to scan vast volumes of pages.  The following are details on how to leverage the power of many advanced functions, and unlike the above, these directions assume you are familiar installing dependencies on your own and doing light editing of Python3 code.</p>

				<h3>Analyze a Single Page</h3>
					<p>Sometimes you just want to run a single quick scan, to do so, use the command below.  Be sure to replace "http://example.com" with the address of the site you want to scan.</p>
					<p class="cli">python3 run_webxray.py -s http://example.com</p>

				<h3>Run Many Browsers in Parallell to Increase Speed</h3>
					<p>By default, webxray will only run a single browser at a time.  Given webxray waits 30 seconds for a page to load, this means it will take over 8 hours to scan 1,000 pages.  However, most systems can handle running many more browsers at a time, resulting in significant speed gains.</p>

					<p>To use one browser per available processor core open run_webxray.py and change "pool_size = 1" to "pool_size = None" - this is the most straight-forward way to increase speed.  Since webxray spends most of its time waiting for pages to load you may also experiment with setting pool_size <em>above</em> the number of available cores.</p>

					<p>It is possible to do some performance tuning to determine how many browsers you can run before you get crashes.  If you desire to scan more than 100,000 pages, performance tuning is highly advised.</p>

				<h3>Use a More Powerful Database</h3>
					<p>If you are scanning more than a few thousand pages, you will need a database engine far more powerful than SQLite.  Both MySQL and PostgreSQL are supported by webxray.  The instructions below will tell you how to set up each database.  Note that most webxray development has been done on MySQL and PostgreSQL has therefore undergone less testing.</p>

					<h4>To use MySQL:</h4>

						<p>First you must install MySQL: <a href="https://www.mysql.com">https://www.mysql.com</a> and the mysql-connector module for Python3: <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/">https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/</a>.</p>

						<p>Second, because MySQL's version of unicode is not actual unicode, you must configure your database to use real unicode which MySQL calls 'utf8mb4'.  Follow this guide to get MySQL to work correctly, note you only need to follow Step 5, ignore the rest: <a href="https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/mysql-utf8mb4#character-sets">https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/mysql-utf8mb4#character-sets</a>.</p>

						<p>Third, you must configure webxray to use MySQL, to do so open the file 'run_webxray.py', find the line "db_engine = 'sqlite'" and change it to "db_engine = 'mysql'".</p>

						<p>Fourth, open the file './webxray/MySQLDriver.py' and update your username and password in the '__init__' function.</p>

						<p>You should be all set to use MySQL now, run webxray as you normally would.</p>

					<h4>To use PostgreSQL:</h4>

						<p>First, you must install PostgreSQL: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">https://www.postgresql.org</a> and the psycopg2 module for Python3: <a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">http://initd.org/psycopg/</a>.</p>

						<p>Second, you must configure webxray to use PostgreSQL, to do so open the file 'run_webxray.py' find the line "db_engine = 'sqlite'" and change it to "db_engine = 'postgres'".</p>

						<p>Third, open the file './webxray/PostgreSQLDriver.py' and update your username and password in the '__init__' function.</p>

						<p>You should be all set to use PostgreSQL now, run webxray as you normally would.</p>

				<h3>Change How Long the Browser Waits After Loading a Page</h3>
		
					<p>In order to get all the third-party elements possible, webxray waits for 30 seconds after loading a page.  You can make this longer or shorter by changing the line "browser_wait = 30" in run_webxray.py.  Note that 30 seconds works very well, and due to specifics of Chrome, setting it to fewer than 30 seonds may result in lost cookies.</p>

				<h3>Run Chrome in Windowed Mode</h3>
		
					<p>By default, Chrome is run without a window opening on your computer which uses less resources, is less annoying, and is required if your computer doesn't have a monitor.  If you do want to see pages loading you can enable 'windowed' mode by opening the file './webxray/ChromeDriver.py', finding the line "self.headless = True", and changing it to " self.headless = False".</p>

				<h3>Use PhantomJS</h3>
		
					<p>The state of the PhantomJS is in dissarray as people are moving to Chrome.  This is sad as the browser is extremely resource-friendly and very useful for scanning large volumes of web pages.  If you still want to use PhantomJS you must first install it on your system, then open the run_webxray.py file and change the line "browser_type = 'chrome'" to "browser_type = 'phantomjs'".</p>

				<h3>Hash Elements</h3>
	
					<p>It is possible to have webxray calculate the MD5 hash of all elements being downloaded.  This is useful if you want to check for malware and other tasks.  In the 'store' function of of './webxray/OutputStore.py' you will find the 'get_file_hashes' and 'hash_3p_only' parameters, modify them as desired.  Note that elements must be re-downloaded for hashing so it slows down your network connection considerably and makes heavy CPU demands as you are runnig a ton of hashing operations.  This is why it is off by default.</p>

				<h3>Hidden Options</h3>
			
					<p>There are many options hidden throughout the code base, most often you can find hints in function parameters and by running this command:</p>

					<p class="cli">python3 run_webxray.py -h</p>
